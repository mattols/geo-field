### **A Brief Introduction to R**

R is a free software environment used for statistical computing and graphics. It is very useful for analyzing data, including geographic information, because it can handle numbers, tables, and even geographic coordinates and map projections easily.

You can download R for free from: 

* CRAN: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
* After installing R, you can also install RStudio, which is a user-friendly interface for R, from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

**Lab computers should have R & RStudio pre-installed**

> **Open RStudio**

In the console, copy and paste this code:

```r
print("hello geospatial world!")
```

click `enter` on your keyboard to run the code.

Great work! You ran your first bit of code.

Below we will cover a few important operations in R to help with this weeks assignment. **Prior programming experience is NOT necessary to complete this assignment!**

<br>

___

#### **R Basics:** Arithmetic, Variables, Structures, and Functions

R can be used like a calculator:

```r
2 + 3  # adds two numbers
5 * 4  # multiplies two numbers
```

You can store values in variables to use in equations:

```r
x <- 10
y <- 5
z <- x + y  # z is now 15
```

Tables, arrays, and matrices store data in rows and columns, you can use the following functions to create a data structure:

```r
# Create an array (numbers in a sequence)
my_array <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Create a table (similar to data frame)
my_table <- data.frame(Name = c("A", "B"), Value = c(3, 7))

# Create a matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

R includes many other useful **built-in functions** for statistical analysis. Here are three commonly used ones:

* `mean()` – calculates the **average**
* `sd()` – calculates the **standard deviation**
* `sum()` – adds all the values

Here is an example of how these can be used:

```r
numbers <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)

mean(numbers)  # returns 12.5
sd(numbers)    # returns 6.454972
sum(numbers)   # returns 50
```

These functions make it easy to quickly summarize and understand your data.

Finally, we should cover how to subset data for more flexible use. In R, **indexing** means accessing specific elements from a vector, matrix, or other data structure.

You can access elements of a vector using square brackets:

```r
v <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
v[1]     # returns 10 (first element)
v[3]     # returns 30 (third element)
```

Matrices use two indices: `[row, column]`

```r
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m[1, 2]  # element in first row, second column
m[3, ]   # entire third row
m[, 1]   # entire first column
```

Indexing helps you extract or modify parts of your data for analysis.

For example, if you wanted to take the average and standard devaition of separate columns in a matrix, you could do the following:

```r
# combine indexing and functions
mean(m[, 1])  # the mean value of the first matrix column
sd(m[, 2])    # the standard deviation of the second column
```
Additional functions can speed this process up, such as `apply` or `colMeans`, but these are not necessary for this lab.

**R is like Excel**, only much more flexible, more useful, and much more powerful in the long run. Students should learn to use this valuable tool.


___

#### **R Basics:** Reading and Plotting Point Data

Here is how to create a simple matrix with two points (x, y) and plot them:

```r
points <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)  # two points: (1,2) and (3,4)
colnames(points) <- c("x", "y")

plot(points, xlab = "X Coordinate", ylab = "Y Coordinate", main = "Simple Plot of Points")

# or with individual variables
x <- c(1, 3)
y <- c(2,4)
plot(x, y)
```

See more with the `?plot` function.

___

#### **R Basics:** Annotating Code and Saving Files and Code

Comments help explain your code and start with `#`:

```r
# This calculates the sum of two numbers
a <- 5
b <- 7
sum <- a + b  # sum equals 12
```

These lines will not be run and are intended to help you and others understand what is going on.

R runs code in the console, but it can be usefult to write and save your code. An **R script** is a plain text file that contains a series of R commands. The file usually ends in `.R`. You can open and edit R scripts in RStudio or any text editor.

Using an R script is helpful because:

* It **saves your work**, so you don’t have to retype commands every time.
* You can **run your code in parts**, making it easier to test and debug.
* It helps you **stay organized** by keeping all your analysis steps in one place.
* You can **add comments** (using `#`) to explain what each section of your code does.

To create an R script in **RStudio**:

1. Go to the top menu and click `File` → `New File` → `R Script`.
2. Save the file using `File` → `Save` (use `.R` as the file extension).
3. You can run a line or section of code by highlighting it and pressing **Ctrl + Enter** (or **Cmd + Enter** on Mac).


___

After creating or modifying data in R, you may want to save it so you can use it later or share it with others. One common format for saving data is **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**, which can be opened by many programs like Excel.

To save a table or data frame as a CSV file, use the `write.csv()` function:

```r
# Create a simple data frame
my_data <- data.frame(Name = c("Alice", "Bob"), Score = c(90, 85))

# Save it as a CSV file named "my_data.csv"
write.csv(my_data, file = "my_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

* `file` specifies the name of the file to save.
* `row.names = FALSE` prevents R from adding row numbers as a separate column.

This file will be saved in your current working directory, which you can check with `getwd()` or change with `setwd()`. You can also specify another path in the filename. 

You can read in tabular data with `read.csv(csv_filename)` or `read.table` for other specific tabular files.


___
#### **R Basics:** Other functions

In R, you can add extra tools called packages. Packages extend R’s capabilities for specific tasks like mapping or data analysis. To install a package, use:

```r
install.packages("packageName")
```

And to use it in your code, load it with:

```r
library(packageName)
```

This is one of the greatest advantages that R (and other open-source programming languages) have over ArcGIS Pro.

*One Final Note:*

In general, R is similar in capabilities and functionality to Matlab, Python, Julia, and other programming software. There is no *best* programming language to learn, all have their strengths. In today's geospatial world, the most important  thing is that you learn *some* bit of programming to keep up with this rapidly evolving field! It is also useful in many other settings.

## **Section 1:** Shape of the Earth and Ellipsoid

Important vocabulary:

| Term      | Explanation                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Datum     | Reference point or surface for measuring locations on Earth.             |
| Ellipsoid | A mathematically defined, smooth shape approximating Earth's shape.      |
| Geoid     | The shape of Earth's mean sea level, used as a vertical reference.       |
| GCS       | Geographic Coordinate System, using latitude and longitude.              |
| WGS84     | A global datum and coordinate system used by GPS.                        |
| NAD       | North American Datum, used mainly in North America (e.g., NAD27, NAD83). |
| PCS       | Projected Coordinate System, converting 3D Earth to flat maps.           |
| UTM       | Universal Transverse Mercator, a common projected coordinate system.     |


<br>



The Earth is not a perfect sphere but an ellipsoid, slightly flattened at the poles. The **semi-major axis** is the longest diameter of the ellipsoid, stretching from the center to the surface at the equator. This is a key parameter in most Earth models like **WGS84** and **GRS80**. The **semi-minor axis** is the shorter diameter, with a radius from the center to a pole.


For example, the **GRS80 ellipsoid** (used to define NAD83) has the following properties:

* Semimajor axis (equatorial radius): **6,378,137 meters**
* Flattening (f): **1 / 298.257222101**


Flattening is calculated as:

$$
f = \frac{a - b}{a}
$$

where:

* $a$ = semimajor axis
* $b$ = semiminor axis (polar radius)

Note that you can use the information above to find information about the semi-minor axis and the difference between the two axes for an ellipsoid. 

**Purpose:** You will respond to a few questions about the ellipsoid in this assignment.

<br>

___

## **Section 2:** Calculating Distance with Pythagorean Theorem

When working with points on a flat surface (like a map or a local projected coordinate system), we can measure the straight-line distance between two points using the **Pythagorean Theorem**. Condiser the following figure and recall the basic relationship with right triangles:

```{r include_image, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/pythagoras-bbc.png")
```

*source: BBC*

This same concept can be used with spatial data. If you know the coordinates of two points — say, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ — the distance between them is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. We can rewrite the equation above as:

$$
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

This method works well for **short distances** or in **planar coordinate systems** like UTM, but it becomes less accurate for long distances on the curved surface of the Earth (where spherical or ellipsoidal formulas are used instead).

Example in R:

```r
x1 <- 1; y1 <- 2
x2 <- 4; y2 <- 6
distance <- sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
distance
```
Note that `sqrt()` is a built-in R function to calculate the square root. You can look up help for any function by running `?` followed by the function name (e.g. `?sqrt`). You can also use the *Help* tab in the lower right window.

**Purpose:** You will used this step to calculate the distance between your measured points.

<br>

___

## **Section 3:** UTM Zones, Scaling, and Distortion

UTM divides the world into 60 zones, each 6 degrees wide. Zone 12N covers longitude 114°W to 108°W in the Northern Hemisphere.

Because UTM projects the curved Earth onto a flat surface, there is distortion, especially toward the edges of each zone. Distortion increases as you move east or west from the central meridian of the zone.

* The scale factor at the central meridian is 0.9996 (slightly less than 1), reducing distortion near the center.
* At about 3° east or west from the center, scale factor approaches 1 (no scale distortion).
* Beyond that, scale distortion increases.

**Purpose:** You will use this information to calculate the amount of distortion that could occur from using this projection.

<br>



___

## **Section 4:** Spatial Data in R with `terra`

The `terra` package is used to work with spatial data. Note, that you will need to install this package, which may not work on any computer without properly installing other dependencies. This should work well in the lab.

Install and load `terra`:

```r
install.packages("terra")
library(terra)
```

Create point data and assign a coordinate system:

```r
# Create points
points <- vect(matrix(c(-111.7153362, 40.27748851,
                        -111.7154452, 40.27747235,), ncol=2, 
                      byrow=TRUE), type="points")

# Assign coordinate system information (WGS84)
crs(points) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"

```

The `crs()` assignment step above is the coordinate reference system assignment. This includes all necessary information about the ellipsoid, datum, and even projection required in spatial data.

```
crs(points) <- "EPSG:4326"  # WGS84
```

Other common EPSG codes:

* NAD27: "EPSG:4267"
* NAD83: "EPSG:4269"
* UTM Zone 12N (WGS84): "EPSG:32612"

Spatial data can be visualized by plotting with the same base `plot` functions.

Optional Mapping with `leaflet` can make things look quite a bit cooler.

Install and load the `leaflet` package:

```r
install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)
```

Plot points interactively:

```r
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = c(-111.715283, -111.715451), lat = c(40.27754852, 40.2775552), popup = c("Point 1", "Point 2"))
```

Submit your R script and responses to these questions in the Lab 2 Canvas assignment (*include a short code snippet for each step*)

#### **Questions:**

1. Using the information above, Calculate the semi-minor axis of the GRS80 ellipsoid, which is the basis for NAD83 and and is applicable to ITRF and IGS.
2. Calculate the difference in ellipsoid radius at the poles compared to the equator.
3. If you were tasked with drilling a hole to the center of the Earth, and wanted to minimize the distance to be drilled, where would you go to do it?

Absolutely — the original questions are written in a very technical and compact way. Here’s a rewritten version that’s clearer, more structured, and easier to follow while keeping the technical depth.

---

## 🔍 **Rewritten Version of the Problem Sets**

---

### **Problem A: UTM Distortion and Plant Survey**

Imagine you're working on two field projects in **UTM Zone 12**, using UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates. In both cases, you're walking along an **east-west path that is 1 km long**, and you're counting the number of **Great Basin Sagebrush** plants that are within 10 meters of your path.

* The first project is located at an **easting of 500,000 meters** (which is at the center of UTM Zone 12).
* The second project is located at an **easting of 750,000 meters** (closer to the edge of the zone, where distortion is more noticeable).

You're trying to understand whether the **UTM projection distortion** will significantly affect your measurements.

---

#### **A1. How much distortion is there at each location?**

* Look up (online or from lecture notes) the **UTM scale factor** at:

  * The **center of the zone** (500,000 m easting).
  * The **edge of the zone** (750,000 m easting).
* These scale factors tell you how much the UTM projection **shrinks or stretches** distances compared to real-world ground distances.

---

#### **A2. How does this distortion affect your plant density calculation?**

* You’re measuring plant density as:

  $$
  \text{Plant Density} = \frac{\text{Number of Plants}}{1\, \text{km}}
  $$

* But due to UTM distortion, your **actual walking distance on the ground** may be slightly more or less than 1 km.

* Use the scale factors you found in A1 to calculate:

  * The **actual ground distance** of your 1 km traverse.
  * The **true plant density**, based on this corrected distance.

* Then calculate the **ratio of apparent to actual plant density** to find out how much error UTM distortion introduces.

---

#### **A3. Is this error important?**

* Based on your calculations, is the distortion large enough to affect your study results in a meaningful way?
* Consider the **size of the error** compared to natural variability in plant counts.

---

### **Problem B: Plate Motion and Coordinate Systems**

Now imagine a second situation involving plate tectonics.

You and a colleague are measuring the distance between two fixed points on the Earth’s surface, which are moving slowly over time due to **tectonic motion**.

* **Two years ago**, you measured the distance as **exactly 1,000.000 meters**, using the **IGS08 geodetic coordinate system** (which is very accurate for tracking global positions).
* **This year**, your colleague measured the same two points again, but used **UTM Zone 12 coordinates** instead.

---

#### **B1. How much could UTM distortion affect the measurement?**

* Based on your understanding of UTM distortion (from Problem A), how much **error** might your colleague’s measurement include just because they used UTM instead of IGS08?

---

#### **B2. How does that compare to actual tectonic motion?**

* How far apart might the two points **really have moved** in the past two years due to plate tectonics?
* Use a typical plate motion speed (e.g., **2.5 cm/year**) to estimate the expected tectonic shift.
* Then compare this tectonic shift to the possible error introduced by using UTM.

---

## ✅ Summary

This version:

* Breaks the problem into clear steps.
* Uses simple and consistent wording.
* Clarifies the difference between coordinate distortion and real-world movement.

Let me know if you'd like a worksheet-style version or a visual to go with it!
